Description: Implement four new features to pre-existing class code that allow for the user to add another set of songs to the databae, update the songs already present, delete unwanted songs, and remove any songs that have missing values for any of their attributes.

Language: Python, SQLite 

Reason: For Class, learn how to implement SQL code in Python

Successes: once the first two clicked, it made the implementation of the final two realtively simple

Setbacks: figuring out how to properly append to the queries without breaking them and how to properly integreate the "?" placeholder in those queries

Learned: how to utilize cursors and connections to properly interact with SQL queries
